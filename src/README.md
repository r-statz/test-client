# Running
- Must have yarn or npm
- Locally on localhost:3000 => `yarn start` or `npm start`
- To generate an optimized production build `yarn build`
- Heroku `https://statz-client.herokuapp.com/`

# Improvements
- Clearly this is an ugly form!!!
- Given more time I would fix the autofill issue, i.e. if you copy and paste/autofill the onChange doesn't register and therefore state doesn't update
